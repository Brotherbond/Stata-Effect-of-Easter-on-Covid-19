**checks 
impact Catholic H on 
	C19 infections
	fatalities(deaths)
	mobility, how much people travel
	
is mobility a mediator of the impact of the E H on covid infections

**Visuals
Trends in cases,deaths,mobility



** report
Describe data, sample, variables used,
econometric model, regression for impact evaluation && appropriate controls

Discuss findings && suggestions implied in terms of adherence to lockdown restrictions

STEPS:

save covid cases alone
merge covid n mobility

Keep only req. countries

collapse based on mobility fatalities n infections

Create a function to run the two scenerio and save output
explain output after calling function b4 anoda call

	Function:
generate visuals using time series for the groups together
Each vis shows report for the group countries showing differently

1 vis for infections
1 vis for fatalities
1 vis each for each mobility variable
